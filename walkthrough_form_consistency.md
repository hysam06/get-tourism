# Walkthrough - Simplified Contact Form Consistency

I have further refined the contact form to ensure perfect visual consistency between all fields and to implement the "MORE" style button as requested.

## Key Refinements

### 1. Unified Field Styling
- **Removal of Groups**: I have removed the "glass box" containers from the dynamic fields and message sections.
- **Consistent Layout**: Now, all fields (Name, Email, Phone, Service Selection, and Message) appear in the same simple style—subtle background and minimal borders—matching the top fields perfectly.
- **Clean Labels**: Section titles have been replaced with simple, elegant labels ("SERVICE SELECTION", "YOUR MESSAGE") that don't create visual clutter.

### 2. "MORE" Style Submit Button
- **Home Page Consistency**: The "SEND INQUIRY" button now uses the exact same styling as the "MORE" buttons on your Home page.
- **Design**: It features a transparent background with dark blue text and an underline effect on hover.
- **Animation**: On hover, the arrow smoothly slides to the right, and the entire button has a subtle scale effect, providing a familiar and high-end interaction for your users.
- **Centering**: The button is now perfectly centered at the bottom of the form for a balanced layout.

## How to Verify
1.  Navigate to the **Contact** page.
2.  Observe that all input fields now look identical in style, creating a seamless and non-cluttered appearance.
3.  **Hover over the "SEND INQUIRY" button** at the bottom. You will see the arrow-slide animation and the elegant underline effect, just like the buttons on the Home page.

> [!TIP]
> This simplified design focuses on clarity and functional elegance, ensuring your brand's "MORE" button style is consistent across your most important conversion point.
