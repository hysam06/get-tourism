# Walkthrough - Compact Landscape Form Box

The contact form has been optimized into a compact, wide landscape design with significantly reduced vertical height while maintaining consistent input styling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Compact Vertical Dimensions
- **Reduced Padding**: Decreased vertical padding from `4rem` to `2.5rem` for a more compact height
- **Tightened Spacing**: Reduced form gap from `1.25rem` to `1rem` between elements
- **Smaller Margins**: Decreased title margin from `3rem` to `2rem` and submit button margin from `3rem` to `2rem`
- **Section Spacing**: Reduced section padding and margins from `1.5rem` to `1rem`

### 2. Landscape Orientation Maintained
- **Wide Form**: Kept the `1100px` max-width for clear landscape appearance
- **Horizontal Emphasis**: Maintained generous horizontal padding of `5rem` to emphasize width
- **Visual Balance**: The form now has a clear wide, low profile

### 3. Consistent Input Styling
- **Uniform Fields**: All inputs maintain identical styling with consistent borders, padding, and backgrounds
- **Professional Focus States**: Navy blue border with soft shadow on focus
- **Custom Dropdowns**: Proper select styling with dropdown arrows
- **Optimized Textareas**: Minimum height of 120px with vertical resize

## Result

The form box now has a distinctly **compact, landscape orientation** - wider than it is tall, with tight vertical spacing and generous horizontal space. This creates a modern, efficient layout that feels professional and streamlined.
