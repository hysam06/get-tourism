# Walkthrough - Contact Page Background Image

I have successfully updated the Contact page with the background image you specified, creating a more visually engaging experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Background Image
- **Image Applied**: I've set `pexels-negativespace-33999.jpg` as the full-page background for the Contact section.
- **Coverage**: The image is configured to cover the entire viewport (`background-size: cover`), ensuring it looks great on all screen sizes.

### 2. Enhanced Readability
- **Subtle Overlay**: I added a 50% white overlay over the background image. This ensures that the dark blue text and the form fields remain perfectly legible while still letting the beautiful background shine through.
- **Ripple Compatibility**: The signature ripple effect remains active and visible over the new background, adding a layer of dynamic depth to the page.

## How to Verify
1.  Navigate to the **Contact** page.
2.  Obsere the new high-quality background image.
3.  Confirm that all form labels and details are easy to read against the backdrop.

> [!TIP]
> This new background adds a professional "travel" aesthetic that complements your brand perfectly.
