# Walkthrough - Contact Page White Ripple Theme

The contact page has been reverted to a clean, professional white background featuring the signature Great Escapes ripple animation. The typography and form styling have been updated to ensure perfect contrast and elegance in this light theme.

## Changes Made

### 1. Reversion to White Theme
- **Background**: Reverted `.contact-page-new` to a solid **white background**, allowing the background animation to shine.
- **Overlay Removal**: Removed the dark blue theme overlay to restore the bright, airy feel of the page.

### 2. Ripple Background Activation
- **Animation**: The existing **MagicUI-inspired ripple background** is now clearly visible. It features concentric circles that pulse gently, creating a dynamic yet understated backdrop.
- **Contrast**: The ripple borders use the branded navy blue at a very low opacity, providing subtle texture without distracting from the content.

### 3. Typography & UI Contrast
- **Dark Blue Text**: Reverted all primary text (Titles, Subtitles, labels, and details) to the branded **navy blue (`#02184C`)**.
- **Icon Update**: Icons and social links have been switched back to dark blue for high visibility and sharp detail.

### 4. Refined Light-Box Form
- **"Box" Look**: Maintained the boxed layout requested, but transitioned it to a **white-on-white** design with a **soft, deep shadow** and a hairline border for definition.
- **Z-Index**: Elevated the form box to sit elegantly above the background ripples.

## Verification Results

- **Legibility**: Verified that the navy-on-white color scheme provides excellent readability and brand consistency.
- **Motion Design**: Confirmed the ripple animation is smooth and correctly staggered.
- **Responsive Integrity**: Checked that the form box maintains its elegant container look on mobile while adjusting its internal spacing effectively.
