# Walkthrough - Contact Form "Box" Redesign

The contact form has been redesigned as a distinct, premium-looking box. This enhances focus on the form and adds depth to the contact page's blue theme.

## Changes Made

### 1. Glassmorphism Box Container
- **Visual Style**: Added a semi-transparent white background (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)`) with a high-intensity background blur (`blur(15px)`).
- **Structure**: Enclosed the form in a clearly defined container with a subtle white border and a deep box-shadow for a multi-layered effect.
- **Corner Smoothing**: Applied a generous `24px` border-radius to the box for a modern, high-end feel.

### 2. Spacing & Padding
- **Breatheability**: Increased the internal padding to `3.5rem`, providing comfortable whitespace around the form elements.
- **Central Alignment**: Maintained the centered positioning of the box within the `contact-form-side`.

### 3. Mobile Optimization
- **Responsive Box**: Ensured the glassmorphism effect and borders persist on smaller screens.
- **Padding Scalability**: Adjusted mobile padding to `2.5rem 1.5rem` to balance compactness with the new container style.

## Verification Results

- **Aesthetics**: Confirmed that the form now appears as a sophisticated "glass" box that sits elegantly on the blue background.
- **Readability**: Verified that all form fields and labels remain clearly legible within the new container.
- **Responsive Design**: Tested that the box remains centered and visually consistent across desktop and mobile views.
