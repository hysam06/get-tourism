# Refine About Page - Layout and Content

## Goal
Further refine the "About Us" page to improve visual hierarchy, alignment, and content clarity.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component] About Page

#### [MODIFY] [about.js](file:///c:/Users/sayed/Downloads/projects/get%20tourism/src/pages/about.js)
-   Change hero title text to "Who We Are".
-   Add a new `h2` heading ("Our Story") for the intro paragraph.
-   Remove the "Our Tours" heading from the tours section.
-   Update animations to include the new heading.

#### [MODIFY] [styles.css](file:///c:/Users/sayed/Downloads/projects/get%20tourism/styles.css)
-   Add styling for the new `.about-intro-section h2` (Our Story heading).
-   Adjust padding for `.about-intro-section` and `.tours-section` to improve the flow and "alignment" between sections.
-   Ensure consistent heading styles across the page.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
-   **Visual Inspection**: 
    -   Verify the hero title is "Who We Are".
    -   Verify "Our Story" heading appears before the intro text.
    -   Verify the "Our Tours" heading is gone.
    -   Check that sections are well-spaced and aligned.
-   **Animation Verification**: Ensure the new "Our Story" heading animates in smoothly along with the intro text.
-   **Responsiveness**: Check the layout on mobile to ensure the new heading looks good and alignment remains solid.
