# Walkthrough - Tourism Rebrand & Content Refresh

The website content has been rebranded from "Business Setup" to "Tourism" to align with the core services of Great Escapes Tourism. This refresh includes grammatical corrections and a more professional, travel-focused tone.

## Changes Made

### 1. Contact Page Grammatical & Tone Correction
- **Heading**: Changed the informal and grammatically incorrect `Ready to start ur journey` to the more professional and thematic **`Ready to Embark on Your Next Great Adventure?`**.
- **Subtitle**: Updated the description to focus on plan-oriented tourism services instead of business setups.

### 2. Home Page Brand Voice Alignment
- **About Us Section**: Changed "Our company" to **"Our agency"** to better fit the boutique travel firm persona.
- **Why Choose Us Section**: Replaced "Our business was established" with **"Our agency was born"**, focusing on the passion for exploration rather than corporate setup terminology.
- **General Copy**: Refined sentences to use "believe" instead of "think" for a more confident brand presence.

### 3. Global Terminology Audit
- Verified that pages like `Services`, `About`, and `Destinations` are consistent with the new tourism focus.
- Confirmed that the "Start Your Journey" call-to-action is correctly capitalized and used in the appropriate context.

## Verification Results

- **Grammar Check**: The primary complaint regarding "ur journey" has been resolved with a high-quality alternative.
- **Consistency Check**: All major user-facing text now reflects travel agency services rather than business consultation.
- **GSAP Animations**: Verified that the text changes did not disturb the entrance animations or scroll triggers on the Home and Contact pages.
