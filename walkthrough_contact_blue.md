# Walkthrough - Contact Page Blue Theme Refresh

The contact page has been transformed with a rich, professional blue theme that aligns with Great Escapes Tourism's branding while ensuring high readability and visual impact.

## Changes Made

### 1. Deep Blue Background Overlay
- Replaced the previous white overlay with a **rich blue gradient** (`linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(2, 24, 76, 0.9) 0%, rgba(2, 24, 76, 0.7) 100%)`).
- This creates a sophisticated, branded backdrop that makes the elements "pop".

### 2. High-Contrast Typography
- **All primary text** (Title, Subtitle, Contact Details) has been switched from dark blue to **white**.
- **Form Titles** and **Labels** are now white with improved opacity for a modern, clean look.
- This ensures perfect legibility against the new dark background.

### 3. Icon & Border Refinement
- **Vector Icons**: Phone, Email, Address, and Social icons now use a **white fill**, maintaining consistency with the new color scheme.
- **Visual Dividers**: Updated section borders and row dividers to uses subtle, semi-transparent white lines instead of dark ones.

## Verification Results

- **Color Contrast**: Verified that all critical information (Contact info, form instructions) meets accessibility standards for white-on-blue contrast.
- **Branding**: The page now feels like a unified part of the "Great Escapes" identity, utilizing the signature `#02184C` navy blue effectively.
- **Usability**: The form inputs remain easy to identify and interact with, as their styling complements the broader theme without sacrificing clarity.
