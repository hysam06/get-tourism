# Walkthrough - About Us Redesign

I have completely redesigned the **About Us** page to follow a modern, minimal, and professional style, incorporating the specific content provided.

## Changes

### 1. New Content Structure
- **Intro Section**: Added the "Creating Memories" paragraph.
- **Features Grid**: Implemented "Curated Experiences", "Diverse Destinations", and "Passionate Team" as elegant cards with icons.
- **Activities Section**: Redesigned to remove the numbered timeline. Now uses a clean **side-by-side card layout** for "UAE Inbound Tours" and "Outbound Tours", offering better alignment and readability.

### 2. Styling Improvements
- **Typography**: Used `Montserrat` for headings and `Mulish` (or sans-serif fallback) for body text for a clean look.
- **Layout**: Increased whitespace (padding/margins) to create a premium feel.
- **Footer**: Set to `relative` positioning to ensure it sits naturally at the bottom of the page without overlapping content.
- **Visuals**: Added subtle hover effects to cards for interactivity without being overwhelming.

## Verification
- Validated that all "business setup" references are gone.
- Confirmed the "Activities" section no longer has numbers and is aligned in a responsive grid.
- Checked that the footer does not overlap the main content.
