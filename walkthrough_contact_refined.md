# Walkthrough - Refined Contact Form (Boxes & Colors)

I have refined the contact form to better group service details and unify the color scheme with your project's brand.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Functional Field "Boxes"
The dynamic fields for each service are now grouped into logical **sub-boxes**. Instead of one large area, you now see distinct cards for different parts of the inquiry:
- For example, in **Flight Tickets**, the "Route" (From/To), "Schedule" (Dates), and "Passengers" (Count/Names) are now in separate, cleanly defined boxes.
- This creates a much better hierarchy and makes the form feel more professional and "functional."

### 2. Button Color Update
- The **"Send Enquiry"** button has been updated from red to the signature **Dark Blue (`#02184C`)**.
- This ensures consistency across all buttons in the application.
- The hover effects and shadows have also been adjusted to complement the new color.

### 3. Visual Polish
- Added a subtle "lift" effect when hovering over the service-specific boxes.
- Improved the spacing and vertical rhythm of the form for better readability on both desktop and mobile.

## How to Verify
1.  Navigate to the **Contact** page.
2.  Select any service (e.g., **Flight Tickets** or **Visit Visa**).
3.  Note how the fields are now organized into separate, clean white boxes.
4.  Check the "Send Enquiry" button to see the new dark blue theme.

> [!TIP]
> This "multi-box" layout helps users process the information in bite-sized chunks, leading to a higher form completion rate.
