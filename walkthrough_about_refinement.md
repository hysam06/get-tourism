# Walkthrough - About Page Refinements

I've completed the requested refinements to the **About Us** page to make it more minimal and aligned.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Hero Section
- Changed the hero title text from "Welcome to Great Escapes Tourism" to **"Who We Are"**.
- This simplifies the initial impact and aligns with the page's purpose.

### 2. Improved Intro Section
- **Added "Our Story" Heading**: Provided a clear title for the brand's narrative.
- **Improved Spacing**: Increased the top padding to create a more balanced transition from the hero section.

### 3. Minimal Tours Section
- **Removed "Our Tours" Heading**: As requested, I removed the redundant heading to let the tour cards speak for themselves.
- **Adjusted Vertical Flow**: Reduced the bottom padding slightly to keep the content feeling cohesive and "aligned" as a single flow.

### 4. Animations
- Ensured the new "Our Story" heading animates in smoothly.
- Adjusted the scroll triggers for the tour cards to appear at a more natural point in the scroll.

## Visual Proof
*Note: Please refresh the page to see the new title and headings.*
