# Walkthrough - Tourism Content Update

I have updated the **Contact** page to replace business setup terminology with tourism and travel-focused language, ensuring the entire website reflects a cohesive tourism brand.

## Changes

### Contact Page [`src/pages/contact.js`](file:///c:/Users/sayed/Downloads/projects/get%20tourism/src/pages/contact.js)

- **Main Heading**: Changed "Ready to Start Your Business Journey?" to **"Ready to Start Your Adventure?"**
- **Subtitle**: Updated to: *"Contact us for a free consultation. Our travel experts are ready to plan your perfect UAE getaway."*
- **Form Title**: Changed "Request a Free Consultation" to **"Request a Free Travel Quote"**
- **Other Services**: Renamed the dynamic section header to **"Travel Service Details"**

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- Verified that all "business setup" references on the Contact page are removed.
- Confirmed the new text aligns with the "Great Escapes Tourism" brand.
- Checked other pages (`Home`, `About`, `Services`, `Destinations`, `CountryDetail`) and confirmed they already contained appropriate tourism content.
