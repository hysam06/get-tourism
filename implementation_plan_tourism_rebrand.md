# Rebrand Content to Tourism

The goal is to remove any remaining terminology related to "business setup" and replace it with "tourism" and "travel" related phrases to better align with the user's objective.

## Proposed Changes

### JavaScript

#### [MODIFY] [contact.js](file:///c:/Users/sayed/Downloads/projects/get%20tourism/src/pages/contact.js)
- **Title Update**: Change "Ready to Start Your Business Journey?" to "Ready to Start Your Adventure?"
- **Subtitle Update**: Change "Contact us for a free consultation. Our experts are ready to guide you through your UAE business setup." to "Contact us for a free consultation. Our travel experts are ready to plan your perfect UAE getaway."
- **Form Title Update**: Change "Request a Free Consultation" to "Request a Free Travel Quote".
- **Dynamic Field Update**: In the "Other" service selection, change "Service Details" to "Travel Service Details" to reinforce the tourism theme.

#### [VERIFIED] Other Pages
- Checked `home.js`, `services.js`, `about.js`, `destinations.js`, and `countryDetail.js`. They already contain appropriate tourism-related content and do not require changes.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification

    - Form title is "Request a Free Travel Quote".
    - Select "Other Services" and verify section title is "Travel Service Details".
2.  Briefly click through Home, About, and Services to ensure consistency (though no changes made there).
